# ✅ Edge Tasks

**Edge Tasks** is a collaborative project and task management web app built using **Django** and **SQLite**.  
It was developed during a month-long hackathon — **Website Making Competition 3.0 (WMC 3.0)** — where it received the award for **Best Developed Website**.

The platform allows users to create projects, invite collaborators, assign tasks, set priorities, and communicate within project teams — all in a clean, responsive web interface.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to build a task management tool that supports **real collaboration**, not just to-do lists.  
This project challenged me to:
- Design and manage many-to-many user relationships
- Implement real-time project collaboration features
- Build clean UI/UX while handling full backend logic and data integrity

It became more than a hackathon project — it’s now a fully working productivity app.
